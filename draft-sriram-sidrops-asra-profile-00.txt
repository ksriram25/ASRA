   A Profile for Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA)
                  draft-sriram-sidrops-asra-profile-00

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
   content type for Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA)
   objects for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
   An ASRA is a digitally signed object through which the issuer (the
   holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize one or more
   other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its customers and lateral peers.
   When validated, an ASRA's eContent can be used for detection and
   mitigation of BGP AS path manipulation attacks together with
   Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA).  ASRA is
   complementary to ASPA.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
   content type for Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA)
   objects for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   [RFC6480].  An ASRA is a digitally signed object through which the
   issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize
   one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its customers and
   lateral peers.  When validated, an ASRA's eContent can be used for

   detection and mitigation of BGP AS path manipulation attacks together
   with Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile] [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification].
   ASRA-based verification is complementary to ASPA-based verification.

   BGP relationships that an Autonomous System (AS) may have with eBGP
   neighbors are discussed in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification].
   ASPA object is used to register the set of provider ASes that the
   subject (signing) AS has.  ASRA object is used to register the set of
   ASes with which the subject AS has customer and/or lateral peering
   relationships.

   There are three subcategories of ASRAs defined: ASRA1, ASRA2, and
   ASRA3.  They are distinguished by a subcategory field by setting its
   value to 1, 2, or 3, respectively.  ASRA1 and ASRA2 are used to
   register the lists of customers and lateral peers, respectively.
   Alternatively, if the subject AS does not wish to separately disclose
   customers and lateral peers, it MAY choose to register an ASRA3 to
   register the combined list of customers and lateral peers.  The
   details of ASRA registration requirements for ASes in different
   scenarios are specified in Section 3 of [I-D.sriram-sidrops-asra-
   verification].  In addition, the procedures for verifying AS_PATHs in
   BGP UPDATE messages using validated ASRA objects (in conjunction with
   the ASPA objects) are described in that document.

   This CMS [RFC5652] protected content type definition conforms to the
   [RFC6488] template for RPKI signed objects.  In accordance with
   Section 4 of [RFC6488], this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASRA signed
       object.  This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the ASRA content, which is the payload
       signed by the signer (subject) AS.  The ASRA content is encoded
       using the ASN.1 [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
       [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an ASRA beyond the validation
       steps specified in [RFC6488].

2.  ASRA Content Type

   The content-type for an ASRA is defined as id-ct-ASRA, which has the
   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.  This OID MUST appear
   both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as
   well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo
   structure (see [RFC6488]).

3.  ASRA eContent

   The content of an ASRA identifies the signer (subject) AS as well as
   the Set of ASes that are authorized by the signer AS to be its
   customers and/or lateral peers.

   A user registering ASRA(s) must be cognizant of Section 3 of [I-
   D.sriram-sidrops-asra-verification] and the user (or their software
   tool) must comply with the ASRA registration recommendations in that
   section.  In the case of the transition process between different CA
   registries, the ASRA records SHOULD be kept identical in all
   registries in terms of their authorization contents.

   The eContent of an ASRA is an instance of ASRelationshipAttestation,
   formally defined by the following ASN.1 [X.680] module:

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo as specified in [RFC6488].

3.1.  Version

   The version number of the ASRelationshipAttestation that complies
   with this specification MUST be 0 and MUST be explicitly encoded.

3.2.  SignerASID

   The SignerASID field contains the AS number of the Autonomous System
   that is the authorizing entity (Signer AS).

3.3.  ASRAsubcategory

   ASRAsubcategory can have values 0 to 255.  The values 1, 2, and 3 are
   assigned to represent ASRA1, ASRA2, and ASRA3, respectively.  As
   explained in Section 1, ASRA1 means that the Relationships (see
   Section 3.4) field contains ASIDs of only the customer ASes of the
   Signer AS; ASRA2 means that the Relationships field contains ASIDs of
   only the lateral peer ASes; ASRA3 means that the Relationships field
   contains the combined list of ASIDs of customer and lateral peer
   ASes.  Section 3 of [I-D.sriram-sidrops-asra-verification] for
   details of registration requirements for ASRA1, ASRA2, and ASRA3.

3.4.  Relationships

   Each element contained in the Relationships field is an instance of
   ASID.  The Relationships field contains the listing of ASIDs of ASes
   that are authorized as customers and/or lateral peers (per ASRA1,
   ASRA2, and ASRA3 subcategory definitions).

   In addition to the constraints described by the formal ASN.1
   definition, the contents of the Relationships field MUST satisfy the
   following constraints:

   *  The SignerASID value MUST NOT appear in any ASID in the
      Relationships field.

   *  The elements of Relationships MUST be ordered in ascending
      numerical order (ASIDs).

   *  Each value of ASID MUST be unique (with respect to the other
      elements of Relationships).

4.  ASRA Validation

   Before a relying party can use an ASRA to validate a routing
   announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ASRA object
   itself.  To validate an ASRA, the relying party MUST perform all the
   validation checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following
   additional ASRA-specific validation steps.

   *  The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension [RFC3779]
      MUST be present in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained
      within the ASRA), and the SignerASID in the ASRA eContent MUST be
      contained within the set of AS numbers specified by the EE
      certificate's Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension.

   *  The EE certificate's Autonomous System Identifier Delegation
      Extension MUST NOT contain any "inherit" elements.
